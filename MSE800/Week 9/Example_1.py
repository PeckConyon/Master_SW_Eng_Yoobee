# example 1
for i in range(1, 21):  # change 20 to 21 so 20 will be included
    #print(i) - it only prints from 1-19  when we used the range 1 to 20
    if i == 20:
        print(f"You got it!")

# Describe the problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. what is the loop doing?
# Iterating a range from 1 to 20 (20 is excluded)

# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it!"?
# When the value of i in current iteration is equals to 20

# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# I will be like 1,2,3,.......upto 19
