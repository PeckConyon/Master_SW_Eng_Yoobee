unit testing will help to stop/minimize propagation or bubble up many issues to qa cycles and also for
productions that because developers will have to perform unit testing for smaller testable functions
during the development stage. Also the test cases should be written separately. Using unit testing 
an output of a particular function can be tested against possible output/s to verify that function behave as expected. 
As we test smaller units like this end of the day most of the functionalities of the system will be tested during the development cycles. 
QA devs also can reuse the test cases as well.  test cases can be run as individually or as a bulk.
Forcing unit testing is a way to write functions to deal with only a single responsibility.
